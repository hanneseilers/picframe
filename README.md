## üñ•Ô∏è Preparing your Raspberry Pi

### On Windows:

1. Download and install [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/).
2. Flash **Raspberry Pi OS Lite (32-bit)** onto an SD card.
3. Enable SSH:
   - After flashing, create an empty file named `ssh` (without extension) in the boot partition.
4. Insert the SD card into the Pi and boot it up.
5. Find the Pi's IP address in your router or via an app like Fing.

---

### On Linux:

1. Install `rpi-imager` or use `dd` to flash **Raspberry Pi OS Lite** to the SD card.
2. After flashing:
   ```bash
   touch /media/YOUR_USER/boot/ssh
   ```
   *(adjust path if needed)*
3. Insert SD card and boot the Pi.
4. Find the IP address via router interface or:
   ```bash
   nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24
   ```

---

## üîå First SSH Connection

Connect to your Pi:
```bash
ssh pi@<your-pi-ip>
# Default password: raspberry
```

It is recommended to immediately change the password:
```bash
passwd
```

After rebooting the Pi:

- The slideshow will automatically start
- Images and videos will be displayed in order based on their file dates

  ```
  http://<your-pi-ip>:5000
  ```

You can:
- Change the slideshow timeout
- Trigger manual cloud syncs
- (Optionally) configure WiFi settings if needed

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Additional Commands

- Reset hidden cursor (if needed manually):
  ```bash
  ~/reset_cursor.sh
  ```

- Manually trigger a sync:
  ```bash
  ~/sync_slideshow.sh
  ```

- Restart slideshow (after settings change):
  ```bash
  sudo reboot
  ```

## üìö Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|:---|:---|
| Slideshow not starting | Check `.xinitrc` and ensure last line is `~/slideshow.sh` |
| No WiFi connection | Hotspot mode should activate automatically |
| Cursor visible again | Run `~/hide_cursor.sh` or reboot |
| Cannot connect to web UI | Check if Flask service is running: `sudo systemctl status flask-web` |
